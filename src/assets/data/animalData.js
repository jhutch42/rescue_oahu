        description: 'Winnifred (Freddie) was rescued along 59 other dogs from Makaha. We dont know much about her past, but when she arrived at HDF, she was very shut down--wanting to make herself as small and inconspicuous as possible.It will be a been a slow road with Freddie, but shes already coming out of her shell, going for walks, eating and drinking on her own and even greeting her foster mom at the door with a wagging tail.      Freddie is about 5 years old, weighs 60lbs, is current on her vaccinations and is heartworm positive.    Freddie is most afraid of humans, so we think her ideal home is free from fast moving small children. She does, however, enjoy the company of other dogs, as they seem to give her confidence, so a home with at least 1 dog would be ideal.',
